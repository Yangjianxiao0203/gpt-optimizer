# GPT-Attention Model Project

This repository contains a collection of optimizers and a GPT-based model implementation using the Transformer encoder architecture. 

## Optimizers

We've implemented several popular optimization algorithms which are critical for training deep learning models. These include:

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: A simple yet effective optimization method that performs a parameter update for each training example.
  
- **Adam**: An algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments.
  
- **AdamW**: An extension of Adam which offers better training dynamics by decoupling the weight decay from the optimization steps.

These optimizers are essential for the training process and can be found in the `optimizer` module within this repository.

## GPT Model Implementation

The `attentionmodel.py` file includes the implementation of a standard GPT model built upon the Transformer encoder layers. The implementation is designed to capture the intricacies of the Transformer architecture, specifically tailored for generative pre-training.

## Training and Text Generation

In our Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`), we demonstrate the training procedure for the GPT model. The notebooks guide you through the steps taken to train the model with detailed comments and explanations.

Additionally, the notebooks include sections on generating text predictions. You can leverage the pre-trained model to generate text based on a given prompt, showcasing the model's ability to produce coherent and contextually relevant text sequences.

## Pre-trained Model

After the training process, the saved model can be found in the repository. You can use this pre-trained model to perform text generation tasks without the need to retrain the model from scratch.

For detailed usage instructions, including how to train the model or generate text, please refer to the Jupyter Notebooks provided in this repository.

We hope that this repository serves as a valuable tool for those interested in exploring the capabilities of Transformer-based models in natural language processing tasks.
